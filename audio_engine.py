"""
Audio capture / delay / render engine.

Pipeline:
  Windows apps -> "CABLE Input" (virtual device, becomes your Windows
  default output) -> we capture from "CABLE Output" (the matching
  virtual recording device) -> fan out to:
      (a) a delayed render thread that writes to your REAL speakers,
          held back by config['local_delay_ms'] so it lines up with
      (b) one HTTP stream per enabled Sonos speaker (undelayed on our
          end -- Sonos adds its own delay on the receiving side).

We never write anything to your real speakers except through this
delayed path, so there is exactly one "instant" copy (Sonos, delayed by
Sonos itself) and one deliberately-delayed copy (your PC speakers) --
tune local_delay_ms until they land together.

    This is shared by every stage that can push a sample past full scale
    (the volume boost, and the EQ boosting a band hard enough to do the
    same on its own) so nothing downstream ever has to clean up after a
    hard clip that already happened upstream -- once a signal's been
    hard-clipped, that distortion can't be undone later in the chain.

    Uses excess/(excess+width) rather than tanh(excess/width): tanh
    saturates to (numerically) exactly 1.0 within about 3-4x the knee
    width, so anything past that -- easily reached by a large EQ boost
    stacked on already-loud audio, verified directly: a +24dB bass boost
    on a 90%-of-full-scale tone pinned 77% of all samples to the exact
    same ceiling value with tanh -- collapses to one repeated value for
    a long stretch, which is audibly indistinguishable from a hard clip
    no matter how smooth the math generating it was. The rational curve
    below never actually reaches 1.0 for any finite input, so it keeps
    differentiating samples (and therefore keeps sounding like
    compression, not a flat top) even at extreme gain."""
