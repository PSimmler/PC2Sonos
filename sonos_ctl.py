# delay creeping up well past that (641ms, then 911, 1090, 1270ms on the

    needed -- just the UPnP transport clock the speaker already reports.

    Restarting the stream gives a precisely-known zero point (the instant
    play_uri() returns, on our clock) to measure from. RelTime only has
    1-second resolution, so a single reading has up to ~1s of quantization
    error; polling through several tick-overs and taking the median of
    (wall_clock_at_tick - RelTime_at_tick) across all of them cancels most
    of that out.

    Caveat this doesn't capture: this measures when Sonos's transport
    clock starts counting, which is presumably close to but not
    necessarily bit-for-bit identical to the exact instant sound becomes
    audible (there could be additional internal decode/buffer-priming
